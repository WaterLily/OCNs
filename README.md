OCNs
====
This program models two- and three-dimensional OCNs.
The logic is contained in Model.java.
It can be run in two different ways:
  RunTests.java contains code to run many simulations in sequence and collect statistics from them.
  Running Main.java creates and displays a single OCN that can be interacted with via command prompt; using this, networks can be read or saved in XGMML format.
